IMAGINE THERE'S NO COUNTRIES
IT ISN'T HARD TO DO
NOTHING TO KILL OR DIE FOR
AND NO RELIGION TOO
IMAGINE ALL THE PEOPLE LIVING LIFE IN PEACE, YOU
YOU MAY SAY I'M A DREAMER
BUT I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE
I HOPE SOME DAY YOU'LL JOIN US
AND THE WORLD WILL BE AS ONE
IMAGINE NO POSSESSIONS
I WONDER IF YOU CAN
NO NEED FOR GREED OR HUNGER
A BROTHERHOOD OF MAN
IMAGINE ALL THE PEOPLE SHARING ALL THE WORLD, YOU
YOU MAY SAY I'M A DREAMER
BUT I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE
I HOPE SOME DAY YOU'LL JOIN US
AND THE WORLD WILL BE AS ONE
